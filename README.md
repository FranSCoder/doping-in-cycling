# Doping in Cycling Graph :syringe:	

## What is this project? :bulb:

This app is a graph that showcases data about record holder cyclers. The Y-axis represents the mark of the record and the X-axis represents the year it was made. The blue points represent cyclers who have recognised substance abuse and orange points clean cyclers.
